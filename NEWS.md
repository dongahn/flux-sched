   Examples of selecting various algorithms are
   (first remove any loaded sched plugin, e.g., flux module remove sched.fcfs):

  - *Conservative* : `flux module load sched.backfill reserve-depth=-1`
  - *EASY*         : `flux module load sched.backfill reserve-depth=1`
  - *Hybrid*       : `flux module load sched.backfill reserve-depth=4`
  - *Pure*         : `flux module load sched.backfill reserve-depth=0`

#### Fixes

   now interfaces directly with sched module.
